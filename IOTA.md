IOTA - Generation 3 cryptocurrency
==
## Principles
1. Scalable
2. Decentralized
3. No fee
4. Fast transaction
5. Quantum proof
6. Fixed amount
## Cons
1. Can't perform all smart contract. Only those which transaction order doesn't matter
2. Not free?

3. [Easier 51% attack](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6h2jut/have_ethereum_devs_considered_tangle_dag_instead/divgwfs/) (34% attack)
4. Balanced ternary is not practical right now.
5. They need to rebuild cryptography system and hash function due to ternary.
6. Bad attitude on open source.
7. Not adjustable PoW difficulty will lead to easier attack.

## Tangle
- Blockless ledger
- Directed acyclic graph
- Safer and faster when more people using it
- [speed](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@steemhoops99/transaction-speed-bitcoin-visa-iota-paypal)
- To prevent attack and speed with less user, it is using coordinator.
- 10% hashing power has 0.00001 chance to successfully attack. 34% hashing power has 29%, and 3x hashing power of entire network to guarantee the attack.
